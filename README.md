This repository contains various configuration files for my current linux setup.
It should be considered work in progress as many configurations are incomplete.
This setup uses:

- Terminal: alacritty
- Window manager: sway
- Status bar: waybar
- Launcher: wofi
- Shell: fish with starship prompt

As for my OS I use Arch Linux BTW.
